2. PRs merged into main branch (configurable in future) move associated task to complete, associated issue is auto closed
3. users can comment on tasks (optionally, comments sync with the corresponding github issue discussion).
4. an tasks can be moved back to backlog (only) if unsatisfactory, and edited (editing only possible in backlog).
