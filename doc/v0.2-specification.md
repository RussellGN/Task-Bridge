# features required

1. project dashboard to have kanban board with sections: backlog, in-progress, under-review, done,
2. sections to feature task cards which move between sections based on automated rules
3. task/draft-task cards to be created in the backlog section, specifying title, description, priority, and assignees.
4. task can only move to 'in-progress' section if it has at least one developer assigned to it
5. upon creation of task (not draft), github issue is auto created with email notification sent to any assignees (auto done by github)
6. all drafts remain in backlog section and do not sync to GitHub
7. for now: app syncs project with Github at set intervals, or when manually requested (will use webhooks in future)
8. App limtis most functionality to online-use only.
9. Tasks (with assignees) can also be put in backlog section through the 'add to backlog' feature, but sync to GitHub.
10.   Only tasks/drafts with assignees can move to 'in-progress', becoming assigned tasks, through the 'assign now' feature.
