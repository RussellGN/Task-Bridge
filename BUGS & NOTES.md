## BUGS

## NOTES

1. strengthen API usage tracking and implement effective rate limiting
2. eventually remove app sync intervals, replace with webhooks
3. append task-bridge identifier to GitHub items created by app (e.g as issue labels)
4. alerts and error messages are not exactly friendly..too technical and vague
5. more debug logs/tracing needed, especially in backend
6. need to go through rust code, and refactor, clean alot of repeated and inefficient code
