1. Tasks (with assignees) can also be put in backlog section through the 'add to backlog' feature, but sync to GitHub.
2. Only tasks/drafts with assignees can move to 'in-progress', becoming assigned tasks, through the 'assign now' feature.
3. task can only move to 'in-progress' section if it has at least one developer assigned to it
